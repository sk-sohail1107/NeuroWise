:blue[**Disorientation and Confusion:**] People with Alzheimer's often experience confusion about time, place, and people. They may get lost in familiar settings and have trouble recognizing loved ones.

:blue[**Difficulties in Self-Care:**] As Alzheimer's progresses, individuals may struggle with basic self-care tasks like dressing, bathing, and eating.

:blue[**Mood Swings and Behavioral Changes:**] Alzheimer's can lead to mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and agitation. Individuals may withdraw from social interactions and display uncharacteristic behaviors.

Individuals with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) who had Alzheimer's are at a higher risk of developing the disease themselves. Specific genes, such as the APOE gene variants (particularly APOE Îµ4), are linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's.

:blue[**Age:**] Advancing age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The likelihood of developing the condition increases dramatically after the age of 65, and the risk continues to rise with each decade of life.

:blue[**Abnormal Protein Accumulation:**] The accumulation of abnormal proteins, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, in the brain is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's. These protein deposits disrupt brain cell communication and contribute to neurological damage.

:blue[**Family History and Heredity:**] People with a family history of Alzheimer's are at a higher risk, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the disease.

:blue[**Gender:**] Women are generally at a slightly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to men, although the reasons for this difference are not fully understood.

:blue[**Lifestyle Factors:**] Engaging in a healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity, a balanced diet, mental stimulation, and social engagement may potentially reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.

:blue[**Environmental Exposures:**] Some studies suggest that exposure to certain environmental toxins or pollutants may be linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.
