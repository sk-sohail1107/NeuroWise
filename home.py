It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, impacting millions globally. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, disrupting cell communication and triggering inflammation. As Alzheimer's progresses, individuals experience memory loss, difficulties in daily tasks, confusion, mood swings, and dependency on caregivers. While the exact cause remains unknown, advancing age, genetics, and certain risk factors contribute to its development. Although there is no cure, treatments exist to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Alzheimer's imposes emotional, financial, and societal burdens, underscoring the need for research, support, and awareness efforts to combat this profound healthcare challenge.")

:blue[**Cognitive Decline:**] As the disease advances, cognitive decline becomes more pronounced. Individuals may struggle with problem-solving, decision-making, and abstract thinking.

:blue[**Disorientation and Confusion:**] People with Alzheimer's often experience confusion about time, place, and people. They may get lost in familiar settings and have trouble recognizing loved ones.

:blue[**Language Difficulties:**] Expressing oneself and understanding language can become challenging. Finding the right words and following conversations may be difficult.

:blue[**Mood Swings and Behavioral Changes:**] Alzheimer's can lead to mood swings, irritability, anxiety, and agitation. Individuals may withdraw from social interactions and display uncharacteristic behaviors.

            st.write(""":blue[**Genetics:**] Family history plays a crucial role in Alzheimer's risk. Individuals with a first-degree relative (parent or sibling) who had Alzheimer's are at a higher risk of developing the disease themselves. Specific genes, such as the APOE gene variants (particularly APOE Îµ4), are linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's.

:blue[**Age:**] Advancing age is the most significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The likelihood of developing the condition increases dramatically after the age of 65, and the risk continues to rise with each decade of life.

:blue[**Abnormal Protein Accumulation:**] The accumulation of abnormal proteins, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, in the brain is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's. These protein deposits disrupt brain cell communication and contribute to neurological damage.

:blue[**Family History and Heredity:**] People with a family history of Alzheimer's are at a higher risk, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the disease.

:blue[**Gender:**] Women are generally at a slightly higher risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to men, although the reasons for this difference are not fully understood.
